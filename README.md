# BookListManagerProject
A simple web-based book list manager that allows users to add books with details like title, author, and year.
 The book list is dynamically displayed in a table, and data is stored in localStorage, ensuring that the list persists across page reloads. Users can add new books, and all data is managed through basic JavaScript DOM manipulation.
